### Hi, I'm Tahmid. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior at the University of Texas at Dallas majoring in Computer Science. Over the past couple of years, I've worked at different companies such as JP Morgan Chase and Atticus to expand my horizons as a Software Engineer. I am also the Head of Technology and Co-Founder of FinTech UTD. I have substantial experience with Full Stack Web Development and Data Structures & Algorithms. Some projects I've created include <a href="https://clasico.netlify.app" target="_blank">Clasico</a> and <a href="https://blogsforall.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Blogs For All</a>.
